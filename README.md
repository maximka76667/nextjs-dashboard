# Next.js App Router Course - Dashboard

For this course, I builded a simplified version of the financial dashboard that has:

- A public home page.
- A login page.
- Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
- The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.

The dashboard also has an accompanying database.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
